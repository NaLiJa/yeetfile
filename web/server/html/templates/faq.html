            <summary>How does YeetFile work?</summary>
            <p>When you upload a file using YeetFile, it generates a key using a randomly
            generated passphrase and (if password protection is enabled) your password.
            Your file is then split into individual “chunks”, and each chunk is encrypted
            before being sent to the server. The server passes along these encrypted chunks
            of data to Backblaze for storage. Once either the download limit or expiration
            date has been reached, the file is deleted from Backblaze, and all metadata
            pertaining to the file is deleted from the server’s database.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What file metadata is stored in YeetFile’s database?</summary>
            <p>YeetFile stores:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The number of chunks that the file was split up into</li>
                <li>The total file size, in bytes</li>
                <li>The encrypted filename</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The filename is encrypted with the same key that file data is encrypted with,
            and since the server never gains access to the randomly generated passphrase or
            (if provided) the password, it is unable to ever decrypt the filename.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>What account metadata is stored in YeetFile’s database?</summary>
            <p>YeetFile stores:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The account number</li>
                <li>The remaining monthly storage for the account</li>
                <li>The account type (aka which tier)</li>
                <li>The subscription expiration date (if applicable)</li>
                <li>The email address (if supplied)</li>
                <li>The password hash (if supplied)</li>
            </ul>

        <details>
            <summary>Are files that I upload tied to my account specifically?</summary>
            <p>No, file uploads are not tied to your account. The database does not associate
            account numbers with files when they’re uploaded. Account usage is determined
            by your uploaded file sizes, but these values are rounded down to the nearest
            megabyte and thus do not map perfectly to the actual uploaded file size.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Should I use the website or the command line application? What’s the difference?</summary>
            <p>It’s up to you which one you use, but the command line application has the
            added security of not requiring external resources to be downloaded in order
            for it to work. Using the website requires trusting that the JavaScript files
            sent from the server each time you access the site are the same each time, and
            that nothing has been modified to alter the site’s behavior.</p>
            <p>As far as differences go, there are none. All features supported in the website
            are also supported in the command line application.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Should I sign up with an email/password or just request an account number?</summary>
            <p>Whatever works best for you. With an email/password, you can always recover your account
            if you lose access to your password. Signing up with only an account number means if
            you lose your account number, <b>you lose access to your account permanently</b>.</p>
            <p>Note that you can always add an email and/or password to your account later if
            you signed up with only an account number at first.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What emails are sent by YeetFile?</summary>
            <p>The only emails that YeetFile can send are the verification email and the password
            reset email.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Do upgrades to my meter expire?</summary>
            <p>No, any upgrades you purchase are free to use until your meter runs out.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Is YeetFile open source?</summary>
            <p>Yes, the source for YeetFile is AGPL licensed and available on <a
                href="https://github.com/meddlehead/yeetfile">GitHub</a> and <a
                href="https://sr.ht/~benbusby/yeetfile">SourceHut</a>.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Why does YeetFile charge for usage if it’s open source? Can I run my own instance for free?</summary>
            <p>Although the code is free and open source, there are plenty of operating costs
            (server fees, storage fees, data transfer fees, etc.) tied to running a reliable public instance.</p>
            <p>If you want to run an instance of YeetFile yourself, there are instructions in
            <a href="https://github.com/meddlehead/yeetfile">the README</a> for deploying your own
            instance, with configuration options such as max upload size, where to store uploads, and more.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Why metered usage? Why not a monthly or yearly subscription?</summary>
            <p>A subscription model would be unfair to the user, since a user is essentially paying for
            storage and egress (which are both costs based on usage). Metered usage allows users to use
            YeetFile however much they need, without worrying about using it within a specific amount of time.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Can I pay in crypto?</summary>
            <p>
                Yes, there's a BTCPay server set up for YeetFile that can accept Bitcoin and Monero payments.
            </p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Why should I trust YeetFile with my files?</summary>
            <p>
                YeetFile is designed to not really require any trust, since the server cannot decrypt file content.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, if you truly want to make sure that the system is working as it should
                (encrypting files locally before upload, not sending key data anywhere else, etc.),
                you can verify and build <a href="https://github.com/meddlehead/yeetfile">the source code</a>
                for the command line application yourself and use it to upload/download files.
